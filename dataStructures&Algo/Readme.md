1. What is a Data Structure?
   R: A data structure is a collection of values.

2. How computers store data?
   R: We cand divide this into three: CPU, RAM and STORAGE.
   CPU - does all the calculation we need
   RAM (e.g. where you store our variables) - we can access it very fast
   STORAGE (e.g. video files)

   8-bit - 255 (256)
   16 bit - 65.536
   32 bit - 2.147.483.647
   64 bit - 9.223.372.036.854.775.807

3. Data Structures & Algo
   R: Data Structures: Arrays, Stacks, Queues, Linked Lists, Trees, Tries, Graphs, Hash Tables
   Algorithms: Sorting, Dynamic Programming, BFS + DFS (Searching)
   Recursion

4. Operations in Data Structures
   R: Insertion, Deletion, Traversal, Searching, Sorting, Access

5. Hash Tables
   R: Similar with Objects.
