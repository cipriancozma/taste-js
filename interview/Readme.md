Q.1) What is "undefined" in JavaScript ?
R.1) A variable which is not assigned a value is "undefined"

Q.2) What will be the output of undefined==null & undefined===null ? Why ?
R.2) First comparison will be equal to true because the both represent nothingless and the second comparison represents false because both are different data types

Q.3) Can you explicitly assign "undefined" to a variable ? (let i = undefined)
R.3) Yes, you can, because "undefined" itself is a keyword you can use
